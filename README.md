# SuperBombermanR_Remake
 A fan remake of Super Bomberman R in a custom C++ engine, partially provided by Howest university of applied sciences and further developed by me. Due to the engine containing code that has to be developed and graded troughout the curriculum, I am only able to share the code for the game.
